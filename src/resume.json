    "summary": "\nAbout:\nPassionate about all things tech & scuba with a diverse skill set ranging from systems administration to small business management, film production, group training and leadership. I am seeking a shift from the small business world into an environment that will allow me to further develop my programming and IT skill set.  \n\nLiving on the forefront of IT in Australia, over the last 30 years I have witnessed my parents launch their time management software Smart Alarms into space on the 91 Atlantis Shuttle mission, the proliferation of networks and the rise and fall of the dotcom boom & health information systems beyond.  \n\nOver the past two years I've been teaching myself program, and shifting from the MS ecosystem and into the opensource linux/BSD world. I am comfortable in most basic front and back end languages and the explosion of tooling that's occurred for both web development and systems administration. \n\nProficient in bash scripting and both Debian flavor'd distributions, FreeBSD, and more recently Arch Linux. Comfortable with config and use of Ansible, Vagrant, Docker, Nginx, SSH, LetsEncrypt/OpenSSL, PHP/SQL server configs & basic query/scripting, basic use of NodeJS, NPM, Bower. \n\nCurrently learning the idiosyncrasies of Javascript before moving onto some of the task runners and frameworks out in the wild.",
