# The life & times of Lorin Zahra-Newman

## The workbench of a digital wisenheimer. 
----------------------------------------
 I have been slowly teaching myself teaching myself the fundamentals of javascript by earning some of the new tooling in the ecosystem. __This file is not to be used in a production environment.__ 
 
 That aside, welcome to my third frontendish project all about me. The aim of this project is to create a small digitial space that I can use as a platform to improve my development skills and experiment with design concepts and interfaces.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/HosseinKarami/fastshell.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/HosseinKarami/fastshell)

inspired by [FireShell](http://getfireshell.com)
Fiercely quick front-end boilerplate and workflows.
